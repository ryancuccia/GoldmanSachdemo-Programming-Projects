# GoldmanSachsdemo-Programming-Projects
Hi, thank you for viewing my repository. I have created this to display the work I have done in Python over the last semester to recruiters at Goldman Sachs. Computer science is something that I am facinated in due to its demand for both finely developed vertical and lateral thinking skills. After college I will look for tasks that allow me to combine my interests in business and computer science, specifically using programming for data analysis.
